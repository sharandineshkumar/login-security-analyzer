# Chrome Extension Icons

This folder should contain the following icon files:
- `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)  
- `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using any image editor. The icons should:
- Have a transparent background
- Feature a lock/security symbol
- Use the project's color scheme (#6366f1, #8b5cf6)

## Temporary Solution

Until you have proper icons, the extension will work but show a default icon.
You can use online tools like:
- https://favicon.io/
- https://www.canva.com/
- Any image editor to create PNG icons

## Icon Design Suggestion

A simple lock icon with a gradient background would work well:
- Purple/Indigo gradient background (#6366f1 → #8b5cf6)
- White lock symbol
- Rounded corners
